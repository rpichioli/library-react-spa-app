# library-react-spa-app

This is a library application built with React to ilustrate the most used concepts within a common SPA (single-page application) and how to use it.

#### Concepts
You will see some stuff like routing, lifecycle, state from root parent as "database", data and state management from child, form usage and shared validation, prop-types to validate properties data and requirement, and more..

#### Running the React application
First of all you must go to the ```/src/``` where you can see a **package.json**. 

After you need to install the npm dependencies using ```npm install```.

Finally you just must tip ```npm start``` to run the React application.
