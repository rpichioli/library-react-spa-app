# library-react-spa-app

This is a library application built with React. 

The objective is to ilustrate the most used concepts within a common SPA (single-page application) and how to use it React-way.

#### Concepts you'll find here
You'll see some stuff like routing, lifecycle, state from root parent as "database", data and state management from child, form handling, data validation, prop-types to validate properties data and requirement, and more..

#### Requirements
You must have **npm** in your OS by installing **NodeJS**, easily found at the official website.

The **npm** is used to install the project dependencies and run it by command line.

#### Running the React application
First of all you must open your terminal and go to the ```/src/``` where you can see a **package.json**. 

Now you need to install the npm dependencies using the command ```npm install```.

Finally you just must enter ```npm start``` to run the React application.

And it's all!
